# Starling-Hyperlink
Some classes from the original <a href="http://gamua.com/starling/">Starling</a> framework have been modified to allow hyperlinking to happen.

Added a package ```starling.text.hyperlink``` with additional classes to support hyperlinking in ```starling.text.TextField``` class. __NOTE: This only works for bitmap fonts__.

Some testing has been done to make sure it works:
- autoscale
- changing text during runtime

#Contribute
Do help to fine tune and improve this, if you guys think this can go places. Hyperlinking has been unavailable for Starling for a long time now.

Thank you.
